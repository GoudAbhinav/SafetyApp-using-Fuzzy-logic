# Safety Apps Using Fuzzy Logic

The pair of apps, sender and reciever, transmit data using the TCP/IP protocol while the danger level is determined in the sender app using Fuzzy Logic.

## Description

These apps were made as an assignment in the Control Systems (ES 245) course offered at IITGN by prof. Nithin V George. The apps are deployble on android devices. Design is so that the parent has the reciever app and the child has the sender app on their androids. The sender app uses fuzzy logic on sound level and acceleration level to determine the danger level and performs various functions based on the danger level. These apps were designed using simulink support package for android devices in matlab.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The apps can be deployed on android devices using the build app function in MATLAB simulink support package for android devices.
